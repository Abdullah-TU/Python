"""
This program demonstrates the usage of a custom class called Person which models a person with a simple electronic wallet.
The program creates a Person object, initializes it with a name and an initial amount of money, and then uses it to track the person's spending.
The class provides methods to print the person's data, add money to the wallet, and make payments.
The program also modifies the class to add a new attribute for the person's address, and implements a method to update the address when the person moves to a new location.
Finally, the program updates the printout method to include the person's address.
